### About the Cognition, Eye, Behavior and Action (CEBA) Lab

Welcome to the official homepage of the Cognition, Eye, Behavior and Action (CEBA) Lab, led by **Woochul Choi**, a Senior Researcher at the **Korea Brain Research Institute (KBRI)**. Established in **2025**, our lab is dedicated to unraveling the intricate mechanisms of cognition, perception, and behavior through a blend of cutting-edge computational neuroscience and rigorous cognitive behavioral experiments.

### Our Vision
**Uncovering the Neural Origins of Dynamic Behavior across multiple scales, species and circuits.**
The CEBA Lab aspires to build integrated models that bridge the gap between human and animal cognition, expanding foundational research to explain unique human cognitive strategies. 

At CEBA Lab, we believe in a curiosity-driven approach to scientific inquiry, fostering an environment where interdisciplinary collaboration thrives.

Our current research is broadly divided into two main axes, but not limited to:

1.  **Understanding Spatiotemporal Information Processing in Brain Circuits:** We analyze electrophysiological and imaging neural data collected from model organisms like non-human primates and mice to uncover the computational principles within the brain.
2.  **Predicting Human Cognitive Behavior using VR-based Experiments and Eye-tracking:** We collect human gaze and behavioral data, inferring changes in cognitive states such as decision-making. We develop mathematical models to describe high-dimensional behavioral data and eye-gaze based information selection strategies, aiming to analyze and predict behavioral changes.

You can find more details in the research tab.
