### About the Cognition, Eye, Behavior and Action (CEBA) Lab

Welcome to the official homepage of the Cognition, Eye, Behavior and Action (CEBA) Lab, led by **Dr. Woochul Choi**, a Senior Researcher at the **Korea Brain Research Institute (KBRI)**. Established in **2025**, our lab is dedicated to unraveling the intricate mechanisms of cognition, perception, and behavior through a blend of cutting-edge computational neuroscience and rigorous cognitive behavioral experiments.

At CEBA Lab, we believe in a curiosity-driven approach to scientific inquiry, fostering an environment where interdisciplinary collaboration thrives. Our core mission is to contribute high-quality science to the understanding of the brain, develop precise and reproducible analysis scripts, and build research papers with strong logical flow and clear narratives. We are committed to becoming a reliable and respected collaborator in both domestic and international research projects.

Our research is broadly divided into two main axes:

1.  **Understanding Spatiotemporal Information Processing in Brain Circuits:** We analyze electrophysiological and imaging neural data collected from model organisms like non-human primates and mice to uncover the computational principles within the brain.
2.  **Predicting Human Cognitive Behavior using VR-based Experiments and Eye-tracking:** We collect human gaze and behavioral data, inferring changes in cognitive states such as decision-making. We develop mathematical models to describe high-dimensional behavioral data and eye-gaze based information selection strategies, aiming to analyze and predict behavioral changes.

We are particularly interested in mathematical modeling of cognitive mechanisms, decision-making, and perception in both human and non-human primates, with the ultimate goal of publishing in high-profile journals and fostering international research collaborations. Our expertise spans electrophysiological recordings, two-photon calcium imaging, fMRI analysis, virtual reality, eye-tracking, and advanced data analysis using Python, MATLAB, and R.

### Our Vision

The CEBA Lab aspires to build integrated models that bridge the gap between human and animal cognition, expanding foundational research to explain unique human cognitive strategies. We are passionate about improving scientific writing and communication skills, especially for high-profile journals in Western academic culture, and learning to use widely accepted expressions, terminology, and idioms to better articulate our ideas. We also aim to become efficient and supportive mentors, guiding students not just in technical execution, but also in developing scientific reasoning, research responsibility, and curiosity-driven thinking.
