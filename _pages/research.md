# CEBA Lab Research

We leverage **computational neuroscience** to quantify **latent cognitive states** that are expressed through gaze and action.  
Our work focuses on **VR navigation in humans and non-human primates**, **sequential decision-making**, **changes of mind**, and **stimulus–action coupling**, combining interpretable models with real behavioral and eye movement data.

### Focus
- **Computational models**: Bayesian, state-space, and biologically constrained models with emphasis on interpretability  
- **Primate cognitive behavior**: Sequential target presentation, cost–effort trade-offs, and change-of-mind dynamics  
- **Eye movement**: Using gaze signals to predict and validate internal decision states  
- **Neural data analysis**: Multi-modal alignment of spikes, calcium imaging, and behavior for causal inference  

More details will be updated soon (see [Publications]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }})).
